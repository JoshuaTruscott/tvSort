tvSort - Sort your TV shows
======
A small program (My first project in Java) that organised downloaded TV shows<br/>
Only working if file has the standard format
e.g. **Family.Guy.S01E11.XX.XX.XX.xxx**

## Notes ##
tvSort uses only the configuration file to know what to search for, no internet required<br/>
Shows are sent to: **X:\\ [Downloads-Directory] \\ [TV-Show-Name] \\ [Season #]**


## Usage ##


1. Open config.txt
2. Add download folder location and TV Show folder location where specified
3. Add TV Shows you want to sort to the 'Sort List'
4. Save and close
5. Run Program!
